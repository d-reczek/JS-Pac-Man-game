# JavaScript projects

## Pac-Man Game

#### This is my biggest project in JavaScrip, a recreation of the Pac-Man game. In the game I managed to recreate most of the mechanics from the original such as:

- eating dots and counting points,
- eating ghosts after eating a power dot,
- ghosts following the player,
- teleporting to the left and right end of the map,
- Original game sounds played during gameplay

#### After winning the best score is saved and stored in the browser.
